# Existing Features

This document provides a comprehensive list of currently implemented features in the Finance Behavioral System.

## 🔐 User Authentication
The system provides a secure authentication layer using Laravel Sanctum to manage user access and data privacy.

- **Account Management**:
    - **Registration**: Users can create new accounts.
    - **Login/Logout**: Secure session management.
- **Protected Access**: All financial data routes are protected by authentication middleware.
- **Profile Management**: Endpoint to retrieve the currently authenticated user's information.

## ⚙️ Rule Engine (Behavioral Logic)
The core of the system's pattern detection capabilities, providing deterministic feedback based on spending habits.

- **Deterministic Rules**: Implementation of 3 core heuristic rules:
    - **Category Overspend**: Detects >25% WoW increase in specific categories.
    - **Weekly Spending Spike**: Detects >20% WoW increase in total spending.
    - **Frequent Small Purchases**: Detects "death by a thousand cuts" (10+ transactions < $10).
- **Explainable Logic**: Every trigger includes supporting data (e.g., specific percentages and transaction counts).
- **Edge Case Handling**: Built-in safety for new users with no baseline data.
- **API Evaluation**: Authenticated endpoint to trigger pattern detection on demand.
- **Demo Mode**: Includes a `RuleEngineSeeder` with a pre-configured demo account (`demo@example.com`) showing real-world triggers.

## 📊 Dashboard
The Dashboard serves as the central hub for financial overview and quick insights.

- **Summary Cards**: Real-time display of:
    - **Total Income**: Sum of all recorded income transactions.
    - **Total Expenses**: Sum of all recorded expense transactions.
    - **Net Balance**: The difference between total income and total expenses.
- **Data Visualization**:
    - **Income vs Expense Bar Chart**: A visual comparison of cash flow.
    - **Expense Breakdown Pie Chart**: Distributed view of spending across categories.
