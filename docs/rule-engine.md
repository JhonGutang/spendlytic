## Overview

The Rule Engine is the core pattern detection component of the Finance Behavioral System. It analyzes transaction history using **deterministic, heuristic-based rules** to identify spending patterns that trigger feedback generation.

### Design Principles

- **Deterministic:** Same input always produces same output
- **Explainable:** Every rule trigger can be traced step-by-step
- **Testable:** Rules can be validated with sample data
- **Extensible:** New rules can be added without changing core logic

### Rule Philosophy

Rules are **signals, not conclusions**. They detect patterns in transaction data and trigger feedback generation, but they don't make assumptions about user psychology or intent.

---

## Pattern Detection Rules

The MVP implements **3 core rules** that detect common spending patterns:

### Rule 1: Category Overspend

**Description:** Detects when spending in a specific category exceeds the previous week's spending by a significant margin.

**Trigger Condition:**
```
Current Week Category Spending > Previous Week Category Spending × 1.25
```

**Parameters:**
- **Threshold:** 25% increase
- **Time Window:** 7 days (1 week)
- **Comparison:** Week-over-week
- **Scope:** Per category

**Example:**
```
Previous Week: Food & Dining = $200
Current Week: Food & Dining = $260
Increase: 30% (triggers rule because 30% > 25%)
```

**Data Required:**
- Transaction history for current week
- Transaction history for previous week
- Category grouping

**Output:**
```json
{
  "rule_id": "category_overspend",
  "triggered": true,
  "category": "Food & Dining",
  "current_week_amount": 260.00,
  "previous_week_amount": 200.00,
  "increase_percentage": 30.0,
  "threshold": 25.0
}
```

### Rule 2: Weekly Spending Spike

**Description:** Detects when total weekly spending (across all categories) is significantly higher than the previous week.

**Trigger Condition:**
```
Current Week Total Spending > Previous Week Total Spending × 1.20
```

**Parameters:**
- **Threshold:** 20% increase
- **Time Window:** 7 days (1 week)
- **Comparison:** Week-over-week
- **Scope:** All expense transactions

**Example:**
```
Previous Week Total: $500
Current Week Total: $650
Increase: 30% (triggers rule because 30% > 20%)
```

**Data Required:**
- Sum of all expense transactions for current week
- Sum of all expense transactions for previous week

**Output:**
```json
{
  "rule_id": "weekly_spending_spike",
  "triggered": true,
  "current_week_total": 650.00,
  "previous_week_total": 500.00,
  "increase_percentage": 30.0,
  "threshold": 20.0
}
```

---

### Rule 3: Frequent Small Purchases

**Description:** Detects when a user makes many small transactions in a short period, which often indicates impulse spending or lack of awareness.

**Trigger Condition:**
```
Count of transactions with amount < $10 in current week >= 10
```

**Parameters:**
- **Amount Threshold:** $10.00
- **Count Threshold:** 10 transactions
- **Time Window:** 7 days (1 week)
- **Scope:** All expense transactions

**Example:**
```
Current Week Small Transactions:
- Coffee: $4.50
- Snack: $3.00
- Coffee: $4.50
- ... (7 more transactions under $10)
Total Count: 10+ (triggers rule)
```

**Data Required:**
- All expense transactions for current week
- Filter by amount < $10.00
- Count of matching transactions

**Output:**
```json
{
  "rule_id": "frequent_small_purchases",
  "triggered": true,
  "transaction_count": 12,
  "amount_threshold": 10.00,
  "count_threshold": 10,
  "total_amount": 78.50,
  "average_amount": 6.54
}
```

## Rule Evaluation Logic

### Evaluation Flow

```
Transaction Data
    ↓
Weekly Aggregation
    ↓
Rule Evaluation (all 3 rules in parallel)
    ↓
Triggered Rules Collection
    ↓
Feedback Generation (see finance-habit-tracker.md)
```

### Evaluation Timing

Rules are evaluated:
1. **On-demand:** When user requests current status
2. **After transaction:** When new transaction is added
3. **Scheduled:** Weekly summary generation (optional)

### Week Definition

- **Week Start:** Monday 00:00:00
- **Week End:** Sunday 23:59:59
- **Timezone:** User's local timezone

### Edge Cases

#### No Previous Week Data
- **Behavior:** Rule does not trigger
- **Rationale:** Cannot compare without baseline
- **User Feedback:** "Not enough data for comparison"

#### First Week of Usage
- **Behavior:** Rules 1 and 2 do not trigger
- **Rationale:** No previous week to compare
- **User Feedback:** "Building your baseline..."

#### Zero Spending in Category
- **Previous Week:** $0
- **Current Week:** Any amount > $0
- **Behavior:** Rule does not trigger
- **Rationale:** Avoid false positives for new spending categories

#### Partial Week Data
- **Behavior:** Evaluate based on available data
- **Note:** May produce less accurate results
- **Future Enhancement:** Require minimum data threshold

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures

#### Transaction Event
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  amount: number;
  date: Date;
  category_name: string;
  user_id: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

#### Weekly Summary
```typescript
interface WeeklySummary {
  user_id: string;
  week_start: Date;
  week_end: Date;
  total_income: number;
  total_expenses: number;
  category_totals: Map<string, number>;
  transaction_count: number;
  small_transaction_count: number;
}
```

#### Rule Result
```typescript
interface RuleResult {
  rule_id: string;
  triggered: boolean;
  user_id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  displayed: boolean;
}
```

### Calculation Functions

#### Category Overspend Check
```typescript
function checkCategoryOverspend(
  previousWeek: WeeklySummary,
  threshold: number = 0.25
): RuleResult {
  const results: RuleResult[] = [];
  
  for (const [category, currentAmount] of currentWeek.category_totals) {
    const previousAmount = previousWeek.category_totals.get(category) || 0;
    
    // Skip if no previous spending in this category
    if (previousAmount === 0) continue;
    
    const increasePercentage = (currentAmount - previousAmount) / previousAmount;
    
    if (increasePercentage > threshold) {
      results.push({
        rule_id: 'category_overspend',
        triggered: true,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        data: {
          category,
          current_week_amount: currentAmount,
          previous_week_amount: previousAmount,
          increase_percentage: increasePercentage * 100,
          threshold: threshold * 100
        }
      });
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

#### Weekly Spending Spike Check
```typescript
function checkWeeklySpendingSpike(
  currentWeek: WeeklySummary,
  previousWeek: WeeklySummary,
  threshold: number = 0.20
): RuleResult {
  const currentTotal = currentWeek.total_expenses;
  const previousTotal = previousWeek.total_expenses;
  
  // Skip if no previous spending
  if (previousTotal === 0) {
    return { rule_id: 'weekly_spending_spike', triggered: false, timestamp: new Date(), data: {} };
  }
  
  const increasePercentage = (currentTotal - previousTotal) / previousTotal;
  
  return {
    rule_id: 'weekly_spending_spike',
    triggered: increasePercentage > threshold,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    data: {
      current_week_total: currentTotal,
      previous_week_total: previousTotal,
      increase_percentage: increasePercentage * 100,
      threshold: threshold * 100
    }
  };
}
```

#### Frequent Small Purchases Check
```typescript
function checkFrequentSmallPurchases(
  currentWeek: WeeklySummary,
  amountThreshold: number = 10.00,
  countThreshold: number = 10
): RuleResult {
  const smallTransactionCount = currentWeek.small_transaction_count;
  
  return {
    rule_id: 'frequent_small_purchases',
    triggered: smallTransactionCount >= countThreshold,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    data: {
      transaction_count: smallTransactionCount,
      amount_threshold: amountThreshold,
      count_threshold: countThreshold
    }
  };
}
```

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

Each rule should have comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **Happy Path:** Rule triggers correctly when conditions are met
2. **No Trigger:** Rule does not trigger when conditions are not met
3. **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions, zero values, missing data
4. **Data Validation:** Invalid inputs are handled gracefully

#### Example Test Cases

**Category Overspend:**
```typescript
describe('Category Overspend Rule', () => {
  test('triggers when spending increases by 25%+', () => {
    const previous = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 200 });
    const current = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 260 });
    const result = checkCategoryOverspend(current, previous);
    expect(result.triggered).toBe(true);
  });
  
  test('does not trigger when spending increases by less than 25%', () => {
    const previous = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 200 });
    const current = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 240 });
    const result = checkCategoryOverspend(current, previous);
    expect(result.triggered).toBe(false);
  });
  
  test('does not trigger when previous week has zero spending', () => {
    const previous = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 0 });
    const current = createWeeklySummary({ 'Food': 100 });
    const result = checkCategoryOverspend(current, previous);
    expect(result.triggered).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test the complete rule evaluation flow:
- Load transaction data
- Generate weekly summaries
- Evaluate all rules
- Verify correct rules trigger
- Verify feedback generation (see finance-habit-tracker.md)

### Test Data

Create realistic test datasets:
- **Baseline Week:** Normal spending patterns
- **Spike Week:** Significant increases
- **Small Purchases Week:** Many small transactions
- **Mixed Week:** Multiple rules trigger

---

## Future Extensions

### Additional Rules (Phase 2+)

1. **Income-Spending Correlation**
   - Detect when spending increases proportionally with income increases
   - Helps identify lifestyle inflation

2. **Time-of-Day Patterns**
   - Detect late-night or early-morning spending patterns
   - May indicate emotional spending

3. **Day-of-Week Patterns**
   - Detect weekend vs weekday spending differences
   - Helps identify social spending patterns

4. **Merchant Frequency**
   - Detect repeated purchases from same merchant
   - May indicate subscription or habit spending

5. **Category Neglect**
   - Detect when essential categories have zero spending
   - May indicate budgeting issues

### Rule Configuration

Future enhancement: Allow users to customize thresholds
```typescript
interface RuleConfig {
  rule_id: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  parameters: {
    threshold?: number;
    time_window?: number;
    // ... other configurable parameters
  };
}
```

### Rule Priority

Future enhancement: Assign priority levels to rules
- **High Priority:** Rules that indicate significant issues
- **Medium Priority:** Rules that suggest improvements
- **Low Priority:** Rules that provide insights

### Composite Rules

Future enhancement: Rules that combine multiple conditions
```typescript
// Example: Category overspend AND frequent small purchases
if (categoryOverspend.triggered && frequentSmallPurchases.triggered) {
  // Generate more specific feedback
}
```
